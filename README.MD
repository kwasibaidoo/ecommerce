# Product Management System
## Description:
Develop an E-Commerce Product Management System that allows for advanced product management using Spring Boot. 

## Project Objectives:
- Implement a robust product management system using Spring Boot with advanced features like profiles, external configuration, and actuators. 
- Develop efficient request handling with Dispatcher Servlet, including interceptors, data binding, and response handling. 
- Utilize Spring Data JPA for relational database interactions and Spring Data for NoSQL stores. 
- Implement binary trees for efficient product categorization and retrieval. 

## Implementation Details:
- __Spring Boot Setup:__ 
    - Initialize a Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Boot Actuator). 
    - Configure application properties for different profiles (development, production). 
    - Enable and configure Spring Actuators for monitoring. 
- __Request Handling:__
    - Configure the Dispatcher Servlet in Spring Boot. 
    - Implement interceptors for logging and authentication purposes. 
    - Utilize data binding and type conversion for processing incoming requests. 
    - Handle response generation, including success and error responses. 
- __Spring Data Integration:__ 
    - Define JPA entities for products and categories with appropriate relationships. 
    - Implement JPA repositories for basic CRUD operations. 
    - Create custom queries using JPQL and native SQL. 
    - Implement pagination and sorting features for product listings. 
    - Integrate with a NoSQL store (e.g., MongoDB) for additional data storage. 
- __Binary Tree Implementation:__
    - Develop a binary tree structure for categorizing products. 
    - Implement methods for adding, deleting, and searching products within the binary tree. 
    - Integrate binary tree operations with the product management system for efficient categorization and retrieval.
